## My process

### Built with

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Typescript
- Unit test with Jasmine
- Formatting with Prettier and Eslint

### What I learned ?

The API you create presents my first opportunity to pull together the skills i learned through the course(udcity full stack nano degree) and tie them together in a commonly used application. Besides solidifying my skills, i also had the opportunity to problem-solve and work with the documentation of a popular image processing utility.

The following are just some of the questions that i experienced along the way:

- Whatâ€™s the ideal workflow?
- How should I structure my project?
- How do I want to write my asynchronous TypeScript?
- How many functions do I need to complete this task?
- What types of things should I test for?
