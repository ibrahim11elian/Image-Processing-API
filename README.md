## Overview

Users should be able to:

- request an image and get back url for it
- do image processing like resize,..
- change the returned image format

### setup:

- you have to install all dependencies from:

```
    npm install
```

- To build the project run:

```
    npm run build
```

- For testing run:

```
    npm run test
```

- To start the server you run:

  This will build the project before start

```
    npm run start
```

- Or you can run:

  This will run the server directly

```
    node ./build/server.js
```

### API:

- For resize image:

```
http://{host}/api/images/resize?fname={image name => must be in image folder}&width={ prefared width }&height= {prefared height => not mandatory}
```

- For crop image:

```
http://{host}/api/images/resize?fname={image name => must be in image folder}&width={ prefared width }&height={prefared height}&top={Y coord}&left={X coord}
```

- For grayscale image:

```
http://{host}/api/images/resize?fname={image name => must be in image folder}
```

- For blur image:

```
http://{host}/api/images/resize?fname={image name => must be in image folder}&effect={bulr effect intensity}
```

<strong>Note:</strong> For above APIs you can add query for change the responsed iamge, the query name is "format" and you can chose from: (jpg => defulte, png, jpeg).

- For gitting image url:

```
http://{host}/api/images?fname={image name => must be in image folder}
```

&emsp;&ensp; - Response example:

```json
{
  "cod": 200,
  "msg": "image found",

## My process

### Built with

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Typescript
- Unit test with Jasmine
- Formatting with Prettier and Eslint

### What I learned ?

The API i created presents my first opportunity to pull together the skills i learned through the course(udcity full stack nano degree) and tie them together in a commonly used application. Besides solidifying my skills, i also had the opportunity to problem-solve and work with the documentation of a popular image processing utility.

The following are just some of the questions that i experienced along the way:

- Whatâ€™s the ideal workflow?
- How should I structure my project?
- How do I want to write my asynchronous TypeScript?
- How many functions do I need to complete this task?
- What types of things should I test for?
